# Hometask: collective Function Time.

## You should type on command line:

    if you want to compile and run:
        -> make run ARGS=your_num_proc
    
    if you want to clear all created files:
        -> make clean

#### Task was to print collective function time such as MPI_Bcast, MPI_Reduce etc, it is research task. You can find my realisations of collective functions in the folder [myCollectiveFunctions](https://github.com/Ilyabasharov/mipt/tree/master/Parallel%20programming/tasks/1%20term/collectiveFunctionTime/myCollectiveFunctions)

#### Input format:

    -> your_num_proc - int, number of processes involved in program
    
#### Output format:

    -> Each process should print its rank.
    
    Example:
    
    make run ARGS=2:
    
    Calculated error in mean: ...
    MPI_Wtick: ...
